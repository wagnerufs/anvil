# Summary

The `qGaussian` is an R package that contain probability distributions functions and others mathematical functions related 
to the Tsallis Statistics [@tsallis]. The user can apply a statistical test to verify how the q-Gaussian distribution adjusts 
to the empirical data [@santahelena]. By default, it is provided the density, distribution function, quantile function and 
random generation [@thistleton] for the q-gaussian distribution.
